admin acocunt 

name: admin 

PW: password


working account of transaction and listings:

name: ant

pw: 12345

Bugs still occuring in our code:
  When logging in, if entering a wrong password but valid username it will still login user but would cause server to fail accessing item page, search page
  and account page. It is recommended to ensure username and password of account you attempt to login to is proper unless these issues will be faced
  Newly created listings made by valid users may not pop up when clicked.
  

Bug fixes
  account page
    displays transaction and listing
      listings will dynamically update, but the transactions wont without server update

added feature
  admin login.
    added html pages, but no functionality
